# React State & Props Demonstration

This is the React State & Props demonstration. Please follow the instructions + follow along!

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Drag your `index.html` file into the browser!
4. Save files for webpack-dev-server to update!

## Today's Agenda

[ ] Two ways to _write_ React components: as a `class` or `function` (also as `() => {}` function as well)
[ ] What is a `prop`? How do we access this? Why is this relevant?
[ ] Re-using components with props + re-rendering with props
[ ] class versus functional components!

## Today's Code Demo Goal
We are going to build a small application that will allow us to click on a Hogwarts house, and we will see a resulting border on the house and its name next to the question: "Which Hogwarts House are you?"

i.e. See the below example.




Which single topping pizza are you?

Peperoni
---------------
| gold standard cheese  |     <-- We have clicked on this `li` element!
---------------
pineapple
peppers
